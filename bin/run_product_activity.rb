# This is main entry point and example usage of StepFunctions::Activity class.
#
# In order to setup this example you need to configure your AWS credentials executing in terminal:
# $ aws configure
#
# Replace the `ACTIVITY_ARN` with you register activity ARN and specify the region.
#
# You can change the activity settings and adjust the number of activity poller threads as well the number
# of activity worker threads. You should also adjust the activity hearbeat, specified in seconds, accordingly to your
# Step Functions state machine definition.
